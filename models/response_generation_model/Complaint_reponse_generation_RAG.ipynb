    "The Llama model's response is preferred because it adheres closely to the instructions provided in the prompt. Specifically, the Llama model ensures that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acknowledgment of Employee Assistance**: The Llama model explicitly mentions that another employee will respond to the ticket soon, as instructed in the prompt. This reassurance is important for maintaining customer trust and setting expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Adherence**: The Llama model strictly follows the prompt's directive to provide a reply that is not conversational but instructional, ensuring clarity and professionalism in its response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the DeepSeek-R1 model ignored the instruction to mention the involvement of another employee. This omission makes its response less aligned with the desired behavior outlined in the prompt, potentially leading to a less satisfactory customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the prompt more accurately, the Llama model demonstrates better alignment with the intended use case and provides a more complete and reassuring response to the customer."
