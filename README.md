
# 📢 Complaint Ticketing & Resolution System  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This is a **centralized complaint management system** designed to handle and resolve user complaints efficiently. It integrates **AI-powered categorization**, automated ticketing, and **real-time tracking** to streamline the resolution process. The system is structured into multiple components, each managed independently as a **Git submodule**.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
✅ **Complaint Submission & Tracking** – Users can log complaints, track progress, and receive notifications.  
✅ **Automated Ticket Routing** – AI categorizes complaints and assigns them to the right teams.  
✅ **Analytics & Reporting** – Visual dashboards show trends, response times, and complaint resolution efficiency.  
✅ **AI-Powered Recommendations** – Suggests solutions based on previous complaints.  
✅ **User Feedback System** – Collects feedback on complaint resolutions.

## 📌 Getting Started  
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository with Submodules**  
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/complaint-ticketing-system.git
cd complaint-ticketing-system
2️⃣ Initialize & Update Submodules
bash

git submodule update --init --recursive
🚀 Running the Project
🖥️ Run the Backend
bash

cd backend  
python app.py  
OR if using Node.js:

bash

cd backend  
npm install  
npm start  
🌐 Run the Frontend
bash

cd frontend  
npm install  
npm start  
🔗 API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs:

POST /submit-complaint → Submits a new complaint.
GET /complaints → Retrieves complaint statuses.
PATCH /update-status → Updates complaint resolutions.
📊 AI & Machine Learning
NLP models (BERT, GPT) for complaint categorization.
Recommendation system for predicting resolutions based on historical data.
Analytics dashboards for visualizing trends.
📌 Deployment
To deploy this system, you can use:

Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages.
Backend: AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
ML Models: Hosted on cloud AI services (Google AI, AWS SageMaker).
