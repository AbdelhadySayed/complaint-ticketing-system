
# 📢 Complaint Ticketing & Resolution System  

A centralized, AI-powered platform to manage and resolve user complaints. It integrates complaint submission, automated ticket routing, intelligent resolution suggestions, and administrative dashboards — all built with modular components and modern technologies.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This system addresses the challenges of decentralized and manual complaint handling by providing:

- 🧠 AI-driven complaint categorization  
- 📨 Automated ticket routing to support teams  
- 📊 Real-time tracking and analytics dashboards  
- 🤖 Recommendation models for faster resolutions  
- 🗣️ User and admin feedback loops  

It is built as a **modular system**, where each component (frontend, backend, ML, etc.) is maintained as a **Git submodule** for cleaner collaboration.

## 🎯 Key Features  

- ✅ Complaint Submission & Tracking – Users log complaints, track progress, and receive real-time updates.  
- ✅ Automated Ticket Routing – AI classifies complaints and routes them to relevant teams.  
- ✅ AI-Powered Recommendations – Suggest solutions based on historical data using NLP models.  
- ✅ Feedback System – Users can rate both AI and human agent responses.  
- ✅ Analytics & Reporting – Admin dashboard visualizes key complaint KPIs and team performance.
